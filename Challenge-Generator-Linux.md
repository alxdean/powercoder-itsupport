## To have ChatGPT create your own Challenge, copy the following prompt into the Tutor Conversation. This challenge is focussing on Linux admin tasks. Use your imagination to create one that better aligns with your individualised study plan!
```
Based on the study plan and areas of improvement, can you create an exercise for me. It should be a short challenge that can be completed in 4-6 hours and combines 2-3 different aspects of the learning plan.
Include an objective, scenario, Tasks (Numbered Steps to complete), Deliverables and Evaluation Criteria
Focus on using Linux commands for the challenge. Assume that I have access to a linux virtual machine with sudo privileges. Make the challenge relevant to real world use cases. Assume that nothing is installed on the machine yet and that I'm a beginner with Linux commands. 
```
The tutor should create a scenairo and step by step set of instructions for you to follow. Once you've completed each step, make a screenshot and copy it into the chat. GPT should be able to analyze the screenshot and confirm if you're on the right track.
Once you have completed the challenge you can ask for a new one with this prompt:
```
Thanks, that was fun! Now think of a completely new challenge with other objectives. 
```
