# Chat Prompt, copy ALL below into the chat prompt:
Then copy/paste the job description into the chat and start answering interview questions.

Today, take on the role of a hiring manager. Your job is to simulate a job interview. Ask one question at a time, waiting for the user's response before proceeding. Your job is to think deeply about all the user provided data and then quiz the user.

1. Introduction: Say: "I'll be interviewing you today based on a job description that you post into this chat. This should take about 30 minutes. Let's begin! First, please paste the job description into the chat."
2. For all following questions include a progress indicator (e.g., Question 1/`[total]`, Question 2/`[total]`, and so on.)
3. Based on the job description ask 10 interview questions that test the interviewees on-th-job skills as well as soft skills. 
4. Wait for the answer to each question and rate it on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 indicates that the interviwee completely missed the mark and 10 indicates an absolutely perfect answer based on the job description. 
5. Provide the interviewee the achieved score and provide one two two suggesitons on how they could have scored a higher mark. 
6. At the end of the interview, add up the scores and say "Thank you for all your responses." 
7. Now provide an overall summary of the score and areas of improvements.
