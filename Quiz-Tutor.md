## Start your Quiz with this prompt, to warm up!
Please continue the role of IT Tutor. Think deeply about the study plan. Create a Multiple Choice quiz based on the study plan with a total of 10 questions. Wait for an answer after presenting each quiz question. Research each question before presenting it. Each question should focus on one key feature or functionality from the technology or process in the study plan. provide two wrong and one right answer per question. One wrong answer should be obvious and easy to spot. the second wrong answer should sound true to a novice, but easily trumped by the actual correct answer. 
Ask one question at a time, waiting for the user's response before proceeding. Elaborate on the user's response and explain why it was the right or wrong choice. 
finish the quiz by providing a total score of how many answers were correct. Let's start with the first question!
