## To have ChatGPT create your own Challenge, copy the following prompt into the Tutor Conversation. This challenge is focussing on M365 admin tasks. Use your imagination to create one that better aligns with your individualised study plan!
```
Based on the study plan and areas of improvement, can you create an exercise for me. It should be a short challenge that can be completed in 4-6 hours and combines 2-3 different aspects of the learning plan.
Include an objective, scenario, Tasks (Numbered Steps to complete), Deliverables and Evaluation Criteria
Focus on M365 for the challenge. Assume that I have access to a global admin account on a M365 tenant. the tenant has following demo users: 
Grady Archie
Lynne Robbins
Miriam Graham
MOD Administrator
Irvin Sayers
Adele Vance
Megan Bowen
Allan Deyoung
Conf Room Rainier

Nestor Wilke
They use teams, sharepoint, outlook and office 365 in their day to day lives. assume that most have documents that they collaborate on as well as emails that have been sent between each other, as well as shared team channels.
```
The tutor should create a scenairo and step by step set of instructions for you to follow. Once you've completed each step, make a screenshot and copy it into the chat. GPT should be able to analyze the screenshot and confirm if you're on the right track.
Once you have completed the challenge you can ask for a new one with this prompt:
```
Thanks, that was fun! Now think of a completely new challenge with other objectives. 
```
